1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,500
Let's start by cleaning up our main dot art file.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,020
We can rename our up to flutter social UI

3
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,370
and then we'll change the theme data to primary color colors upload

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,480
and then below our my app class.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,890
We can delete the my homepage.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:29,200
Class and then for the home we'll type in like screen.

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,860
Now let's create a screen folder inside of lib directory.

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,850
We're going to make a file called like an underscore screen that.

9
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,390
And this is going to be a straightforward.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,550
And I can type in SDF which is the shortcut using the V S code extension.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,660
Awesome folder snippets.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:01:00,610
Hit enter and then log in screen remember to import material by hovering over safe widget holding down

13
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,790
command period on Mac and then selecting material daughter after that.

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,250
Let's have our log in screen return a scaffold

15
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,740
and it's safe.

16
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:20,320
Now go back to main that are and then we can import the log and screen and then to remove the debug

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,220
banner in the top right.

18
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,560
Right under title we can add debug show checked mode banner and set out to false.

19
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:35,030
Let's take a look at our log in screen UI we can see that we have an image here with a custom clipper.

20
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,730
We have a text widget and then two text fields and below that we have a flat button and then a container

21
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,600
at the bottom of the screen giving us an option to sign up.

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,560
Now let's go to our logon screen daughter and we start building out the screen for the screen.

23
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,550
We're going to be using a single child scroll view

24
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,520
and you may be thinking that we could also use a list to you.

25
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,580
But the problem with the list view is that we're not able to have our image go underneath our style

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,670
bar if we have a lost view than the image is going to start over here.

27
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,960
But by using a single child scroll view the image will be able to go underneath the status bar.

28
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,660
We're going to make a container with it.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,320
And we need to specify the height of the container.

30
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,980
And that's just going to be media query out of context that size dot height

31
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,330
and that's our scroll view takes up our entire screen.

32
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,650
Now this container will contain a column widget and inside a column widget we're going to have each

33
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,430
of the different widgets so let's create a child.

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:57,940
Column children our first child will be an image so so image image asset image and then we're going

35
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,400
to pass in the location of our image in our file tree.

36
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,380
And that's going to be an asset.

37
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,450
Images log in to underscore background deejay Peg

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,980
that's it save and we see that the image appeared up here next at the height of the image we'll set

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,040
it to media query out of context dot size dot height divided by 2.5

40
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,070
and then in order to make it feel up to the top of the screen we need to add a fit on this box fit dot

41
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,430
cover

42
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,110
and in order to make sure our image always takes up the entire width of our container we can also add

43
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:59,640
the width property and you stumbled on Infinity next let's add the texture underneath image we'll create

44
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,280
a text widget and it'll say frenzy

45
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,270
what a style to

46
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:23,330
textile color themed out of context our primary color and that's the blue color we set in our made out

47
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,970
our file here

48
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:41,390
font size 30 4.0 font weight font weight doubled we'll see what the letter spacing to 1.0 it's save

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,020
and now we have our text appearing here.

50
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:51,240
Now let's work on adding these two text fields each with a prefix icon we're going to first add a size

51
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,750
box of height ten point 0.

52
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,930
After that we're going to create our text field and our textual who's going to have a decoration input

53
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:01,530
decoration

54
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:12,720
and if we add save we can see our textual appears inside the input recreation we're going to have the

55
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,710
property for color colors that way.

56
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,990
And that's the color of the inside of a text field in order to see the full color.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,440
We need to set filled to true.

58
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,530
And then will the text to username.

59
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:35,010
Now it's at the prefix icon icon icons that account box

60
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,590
and set these sides to thirty point 0

61
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,150
looking at our.

62
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:52,500
You are here we can see that the user name label is not in line with the icon and the way we fix that

63
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,630
is by adding content padding to our input decoration and selling that to edge inserts.

64
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:09,180
That's a metric vertical fifteen point 0 and it save it up bumped our techs down a little bit.

65
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,920
Lastly a thousand padding to our text field

66
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:21,420
edge inserts dot symmetric horizontal twenty point 0 vertical ten point 0

67
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,980
and now we have our first X field

68
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:38,020
now for our second text field let's copy this here including the size box and the padding tax yield

69
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:47,550
it save and we have our next X field we can remove user name and replace it with password

70
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,920
and then I can start a count box we can start as icons dot LOC

71
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,460
and since this is a password field we want to be able to obscure the text because we don't want users

72
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:15,710
to see the password so inside text field but outside decoration will set obscure text to true and it

73
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:24,250
save now we can't see what we're typing for the button underneath our two text fields we're going to

74
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,090
create a container

75
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:40,950
we'll solve the margins to edge insert that symmetric horizontal sixty point of

76
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:55,160
the decoration box decoration color deemed out of context the primary color and also include the border

77
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:05,750
radius border radius dots circular thirty point 0 and remember to add a height so we can see the container

78
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,500
what are the child text.

79
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:20,150
Text in and our container shrunk to the size of our text.

80
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,780
So what are the align property to our container alignment.

81
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:36,910
Center and now our container expanded and we can style our text by doing textile color colors not white

82
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:47,340
font size twenty two point two font weight font weight that w 600 letter spacing.

83
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:57,840
Also to one point five and it save and it looks like I put too much border on our button so let's reduce

84
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:08,080
it to four radius at Circular ten point 0 and then we can add a size box read about our container height

85
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,940
forty point A

86
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,530
in order to make the container clickable we're going to wrap our container in a gesture detector

87
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,810
and add on top

88
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,510
for the final widget of our logon screen we need to add the container down here and when we do that

89
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:43,950
is by going underneath our duster detector and we'll make the container the alignment will be alignment

90
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:54,210
that center just like we did with our previous container of the color theme Don of context dot primary

91
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:54,510
color

92
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:06,860
the height also to eighty point so noted safe and we see that our container appears right here let's

93
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,060
add the child tax before we push it down to the bottom so say don't have an account

94
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:24,750
and remember to add the apostrophe here so we escape it with the backslash sign up

95
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,270
and for styling textile

96
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:41,010
color colors that way font size twenty point font wait aren't we.

97
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
The W 500.

98
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:54,570
Now let's wrap our container in a gesture detector to make it clickable gesture detector on top giving

99
00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,630
an empty method and to push our container down to the bottom of the screen we need to wrap our gesture

100
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:14,370
detector with a new widget called a line alignment fractional offset dot bottom center and that's going

101
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:22,430
to align our container to the bottom center of the bounce around it and then we wrap our line with it

102
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,770
then expanded and once we save we're going to see the container be pushed all the way down to the bottom

103
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,810
the expanded widget is allowing the container to take up the rest of the screen and then align the container

104
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,600
to the bottom center sticks it to the bottom.

105
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,270
So now for the keyboard comes up

106
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,590
we see that the container has still stuck on the bottom.
